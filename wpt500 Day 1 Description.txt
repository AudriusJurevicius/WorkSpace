<p><b>Day 1</b> will end when <b>15%</b> of the field remain.

<p>All players that have chips at the start of <b>Day 2</b> will be in the money.  

<p>Multiple knockouts during the hand for hand process may result in less players progressing to Day 2 than displayed in the tournament lobby.

<p>Please note that there are separate configurations for pre-flop time bank and post-flop time bank and these time banks work independently of each other. For this reason players may see different time bank amounts depending on whether the action is pre or post flop.
